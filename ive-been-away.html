<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>It&#39;s been a long time since I have posted on this blog, and that
is due to a significant health issue. I think I&#39;m back to a stage
where I can start posting regularly as long as I can find 
subjects worth posting about.

Firstly and as a big one, I have retired. 
    Retiring was a big decision based on recovering from a 
    significant health issue.

Many changes have happened in the tech world in the past twelve 
months, so where do I start?
I have upgraded to an M2 MacBook Air for my daily driver. 
Buying this rMBA has been a good decision, and I have not found 
any glaring issues or complaints. I find the keyboard and screen
more than acceptable for daily use and have even stopped using my
32&quot; monitor.
My Linux systems are now running Linux Mint 21.2 and are 
performing well. They both have AMD 1X CPUs and not very 
high-range graphics cards of the Nvidia variety. 
I am impressed with how well these 4-year-old CPUs perform, 
and I wonder why the push for newer CPUs is so constant. 
Because I don&#39;t game with these systems, I don&#39;t need to keep 
updating the hardware.
