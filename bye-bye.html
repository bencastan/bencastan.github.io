<p>For the past 5 months I have been using a 16” rMBP with super specifications:
MacBook Pro 16-Inch 2019
2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9
32Gb 2670 Mhz DDR4
Intel UDH Graphics 630 1536 MB</p>
<p>In no way is this a suitable laptop for what I do, it’s overkill beyond and was only purchased as my previous employer stated this is what was required. I did point out that it was overly spiced for what I do, but they said just do it. </p>
<p>For my Daily Driver, I have a 15” rMBP 
2.2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7
16Gb 2400 Mhz DDR4
Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB</p>
<p>My daily drive is more than adequate for my Coding / Scripting, watching Youtube, and occasionally Foxtel. 
I use it to surf the web and apart from the keyboard, it has the older style rMBP keyboard and I worry 
that the keys will play up. To overcome that I use a keyboard protector which imprints its self on the 
screen when I close the lid, which is worse? The threat of a broken keyboard or the Screenprint. 
On reflection the keyboard and particularly the layout is better on the newer MacBook, the location of the ESC key
and the general feel and useability is much better to work with.
Both MacBooks have 4 Thunderbolt ports and As I use a Thunderbolt Dock (Caldigit Ts3)  and a monitor with 
Thunderbolt input (Dell U3219Q) it is all pretty simple to move around. By move around I mean that I have two
working locations, in the spare room which is an office for me and a place for my teenagers to study and such, 
and a purpose built room in my shed.</p>
<p>I am curious to try a new rMBP with the Apple Silicon but until they come up with a 14” or 
Bigger model I am not inclined to make the change. There is soo  much speculation on the "Next" MacPro
it is rather hard to work out what's best, so once again waiting is the option.</p>
<p>P.S. rMBP == retina MacBook Pro</p>
