# 2nd post for my Blog, This looks interesting.

Over at <https://opensource.com/downloads/kubernetes-raspberry-pi> is an interesting
article on how to make a Kubernetes cluster with Raspberry Pi's.

You get to download a PDF and play with some pretty fun things here. 
Seems it may require several RasPi or other SBC maybe I can give this a try and 
report on it as I go.
