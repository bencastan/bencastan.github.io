# 4th post for my Blog, This is interesting.

Check out <https://pi-hole.net> an excellent add blocker that can be run on many platforms I have used the RaspBerryPi version.

Install could not be easier and then using it is seamless.
Much Kudos to the Creators of this, this weekend I will get around to moving it to a RasPi Mini and then let it run wild on the network.

Also thanks to Brittany for alerting me to this.
