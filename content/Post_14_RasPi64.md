# 14th post for my Blog.
So The Raspberry Pi People released the 64 Bit version os the OS this week so I'm keen to try it. My frst attempts were not successful. Using Pi Imager V1.7.1 on an M1 Mac resulted in an image that would not boot, or at elast would not disply on my Monitor. So I wiped the App and reinstalled (The thing caches the OS Images and I suspect the image was not good) and reinstalled and very slowly created anew image. I say slowly as the App was very slow in creating the SD Card.
Ohhh Turns out the RasPi 4 with 64 Bit OS needs a good stable powersupply. The little wall warts I was using just don't make the Pi happy and it stops working. When I use a Lenovo Laptop supply it's all good. 

Also chasing up a Wordle Solver or at least some way to assit with word / Letter choice when playing wordle.
