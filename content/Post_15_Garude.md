# 15th post for my Blog.
A trap for young players or just the way things are.
Attempting to install Garuda linux to share the experience with my Son and the install 
just casued so many problems. Not being able to boot to the Live Image screens, then not being able to have the OS install. And of course that old linux favourite of not being able to boot the new Install.
I tried for a few days to get it working and thne gave up for the night.
Today I got a different well known USB Drive and used that. Its actually a Cisco supplied USB Key as supplied with thier routers for Firmware updates. Magically ythe whle experience was greatly improved in that everything workd and the OS is now installed. 
Garuda Linux with Cinamon. Its ugly and garish but its working.
Update, stopped usingGaruda as it is just too flaky and not at all ready for prime time. Tryig Endeavour now. Its better.
