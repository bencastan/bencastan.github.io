# 6th post for my Blog.

There has been lots and lots fo chatter and articles on the interwebs in the past few weeks about 
Google's Genius? Courses. These courses are offered on Coursera.org amd seem reasonable in price.
One such article is here. <https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/googles-genius-49-mo-course-is-about-to-replace-college-degrees-340f459aaa9b>

I have enrolled in the "Google IT Automation with Python" course to see what it's like and if it is a good course
to recommend to others. The idea of giving people a quick and cost effective recognised course to help get skills up is
good. I don;t think it will replace a full Degree course but it will put a lot more people in a place where they can 
learn / absorb the on the job practise to get better at their jobs. There is a mention in the Introductory videos of how 
they hope to help Women to get into tech, a good idea just that I'm not sure how this will help.
