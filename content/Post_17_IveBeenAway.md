# 17th post for my Blog.
```markdown
It's been a long time since I have posted on this blog, and that
is due to a significant health issue. I think I'm back to a stage
where I can start posting regularly as long as I can find 
subjects worth posting about.

**Firstly and as a big one**, I have retired. 
	Retiring was a big decision based on recovering from a 
	significant health issue.

Many changes have happened in the tech world in the past twelve 
months, so where do you start?
I have upgraded to an M2 MacBook Air for my daily driver. 
Buying this rMBA has been a good decision, and I have not found 
any glaring issues or complaints. I find the keyboard and screen
more than acceptable for daily use and have even stopped using my
32" monitor.
My Linux systems are now running Linux Mint 21.2 and are 
performing well. They both have AMD 1X CPUs and not very 
high-range graphics cards of the Nvidia variety. 
I am impressed with how well these 4-year-old CPUs perform, 
and I wonder why the push for newer CPUs is so constant. 
Because I don't game with these systems, I don't need to keep 
updating the hardware.
