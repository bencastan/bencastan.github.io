# 9th post for my Blog.

I had the issue of updating my MX Linux system. It kept erroring out that it could not find the repo. A quick search led me to the MX-repo-tool that let me look for the local repos and then select the closest / fastest repo. Once that was done a refresh of the updater got all the required packages and then downloaded them and installed them. A reboot as this was from 91.2 to 19.3 and all good and now I have the latest version fo MX Linux. It's the same for my daily driver Linux Mint system so... Why is Windows so different. Ont he same hardware as the MX Linux system I try to download the latest updates and the system freezes. As in it locks up such that I have to power cycle the thing to get it to respond. Then it's back to the upgrade process which requires multiple restarts as well as doing the Upgrading whilst stopping and then upgrading whilst booting. I find it drawn out and confusing, and not surprising that the majority of Windows users view upgrades and security patches as a chore and something to be avoided.

Ughh, now Windows is giving an "Unmountable Boot Volume" error... 

Boot into MX Linux, run a grub-update and then try booting windows... Now windows is saying it's going to go into recovery mode and fix any errors... ROFL.

In the end, I booted into recovery and forces a rollback of the update, Windows eventually did the roll back and booted. I went out for a few hours and came back to discover that Windows had now applied the update and was working as expected. 


Sheesh!!
