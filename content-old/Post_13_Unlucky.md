# 13th post for my Blog.
Ohhh post number13, is that good or bad? 
Todays subject is CSM and why it is not enabled on my Linux PC after a BIOS upgrade.
When I do the upgrade at the next boot the silly system wont recognise my Del 32" monitor. Turns out you have to enable CSM to make it woork properly and avoid the 4 short beep syndrome.
