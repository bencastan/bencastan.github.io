# 12th post for my Blog.

Have been very lazy and have not been posting for a LOOOONG time. 
I have decided to move this blog off my MacBook and onto my RasPi dev server so I can use any computer the urge takes me. 
Been working hard at resting up for two weeks and avoiding the COVID thing.
Lets see how that all goes.
