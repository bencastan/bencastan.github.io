    <h1>8th post for my Blog.</h1>
<p>Have been off with the Employed people for that past 5 months. Had aposition with Subspace doing Hardware installations around APAC or SEA as they sometimes called it. Mostly this was remote supervision of the builds and I have been amazed by the differences in skills and abilities around the region. Some countries have good staff who know what to do and how to do it, others don't bother with a pretnece of being prepared or knowning whats required. 
Subspace laid me off due to "Change of direction", I have my opinions on that that I have to keep to myself. 
As with any startup they seem to have gotten a bit to adventourous with the "we can build it bigger and better" dream, and of course the Emplyees get to carry the load of the work and the dissapointment. 
Other wise I have been continuing with the Google / Coursera Certification and have one subject left to complete that. 
Tech wise not alot has changed, I have some more 32" monitors and a new Thunderbolt hub which may be the subject of a post soon.</p>
