&lt;p&gt;I had the issue of updating my MX Linux system. It kept erroring out that it could not find the repo. A quick search led me to the MX-repo-tool that let me look for the local repos and then select the closest / fastest repo. Once that was done a refresh of the updater got all the required packages and then downloaded them and installed them. A reboot as this was from 91.2 to 19.3 and all good and now I have the latest version fo MX Linux. It's the same for my daily driver Linux Mint system so... Why is Windows so different. Ont he same hardware as the MX Linux system I try to download the latest updates and the system freezes. As in it locks up such that I have to power cycle the thing to get it to respond. Then it's back to the upgrade process which requires multiple restarts as well as doing the Upgrading whilst stopping and then upgrading whilst booting. I find it drawn out and confusing, and not surprising that the majority of Windows users view upgrades and security patches as a chore and something to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ughh, now Windows is giving an "Unmountable Boot Volume" error... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boot into MX Linux, run a grub-update and then try booting windows... Now windows is saying it's going to go into recovery mode and fix any errors... ROFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I booted into recovery and forces a rollback of the update, Windows eventually did the roll back and booted. I went out for a few hours and came back to discover that Windows had now applied the update and was working as expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheesh!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>It was fun, but!</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/it-was-fun-but.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-12T00:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2021-03-12T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2021-03-12:/it-was-fun-but.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;8th post for my Blog.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have been off with the Employed people for that past 5 months. Had aposition with Subspace doing Hardware installations around APAC or SEA as they sometimes called it. Mostly this was remote supervision of the builds and I have been amazed by the differences in skills and abilities around the region. Some countries have good staff who know what to do and how to do it, others don't bother with a pretnece of being prepared or knowning whats required. 
Subspace laid me off due to "Change of direction", I have my opinions on that that I have to keep to myself. 
As with any startup they seem to have gotten a bit to adventourous with the "we can build it bigger and better" dream, and of course the Emplyees get to carry the load of the work and the dissapointment. 
Other wise I have been continuing with the Google / Coursera Certification and have one subject left to complete that. 
Tech wise not a lot has changed, I have some more 32" monitors and a new Thunderbolt hub which may be the subject of a post soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>I've been slack</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/ive-been-slack.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-17T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-17T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2020-09-17:/ive-been-slack.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;7th post for my Blog.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been having an issue with my Linux Mint Desktop System for the past few months. Ever since I purchased a Dell U3219Q monitor the cursed Desktop would not show the MB boot splash screen nor the Option to boot into the BIOS. Using a different monitor all worked just fine. I had been putting off investigations. I finally got around to connecting up a different monitor and booting into the UEFI BIOS. After reading the manual I toggled on a config for PCIE Compatibility and then stupidly updated the BIOS as well. Goes without saying that the thing now boots just fine and the Dell U3219Q shows the Splash screen and BIOS. Sadly I don't know which of these two things fixed or changed the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google course continues I am at the end of the first section and about to attempt the assignment. I have been enjoying doing this course and the practice/revision has been fun and good. Some of the questions have made me think and stretch my logic a bit which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOS 14 has been released today and I have applied it to the iPad &amp;amp; iPhone and am currently waiting (Not so patiently) for Watch OS 7 to install. Such a slow process has been going for over an hour and it is still not complete, no wonder it is usually done overnight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Google Courses</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/google-courses.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-01T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-01T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2020-09-01:/google-courses.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;6th post for my Blog.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been lots and lots of chatter and articles on the interwebs in the past few weeks about 
Google's Genius? Courses. These courses are offered on Coursera.org amd seem reasonable in price.

&lt;p&gt;I have enrolled in the "Google IT Automation with Python" course to see what it's like and if it is a good course
to recommend to others. The idea of giving people a quick and cost effective recognised course to help get skills up is
good. I don;t think it will replace a full Degree course but it will put a lot more people in a place where they can 
learn / absorb the on the job practise to get better at their jobs. There is a mention in the Introductory videos of how 
they hope to help Women to get into tech, a good idea just that I'm not sure how this will help. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Misc Stuff that needs doing</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/misc-stuff-that-needs-doing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-22T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-08-22T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2020-08-22:/misc-stuff-that-needs-doing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;5th post for my Blog.&lt;/h1&gt;

Listened to Early Alice Copper Albums, Overall a day of stuff. 
Have started on a journey of playing with Web Scraping, using the Real Python article &lt;a href="https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjIxNDUwMCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiM3QwZWpvaWRzZHYwajVpaWhqZTIiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlYWxweXRob24uY29tL3B5dGhvbi13ZWItc2NyYXBpbmctcHJhY3RpY2FsLWludHJvZHVjdGlvbi8_X19zPW92OXdzbTdjbXZmMXVzcXdncGl5In0"&gt;https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjIxNDUwMCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiM3QwZWpvaWRzZHYwajVpaWhqZTIiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlYWxweXRob24uY29tL3B5dGhvbi13ZWItc2NyYXBpbmctcHJhY3RpY2FsLWludHJvZHVjdGlvbi8_X19zPW92OXdzbTdjbXZmMXVzcXdncGl5In0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in speed between Ras-Pi 1 &amp;amp; Ras-Pi 4 is quite astounding, they are much much faster and still the same price. 
It gives me hoe that a RISC Mac Won't be a bad thing at all. 
Bug time::: MacOS BigSur, updates of the Beat causes Git and other things to stop working. 
This seems ot be due to the version reporting for the OS. 
The Solution, manually down load the latest Command LIne Tools beta from &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/"&gt;https://developer.apple.com/download/more/&lt;/a&gt;
Go through he process of re-install. This is a bit tedious as so far each and every Beta Update has made this re-install 
necessary...Sigh!!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Stick that up your PiHole</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/pihole_install.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-12T05:57:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-08-12T05:57:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2020-08-12:/pihole_install.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;4th post for my Blog, This is interesting.&lt;/h1&gt;
