&lt;p&gt;Been having an issue with my Linux Mint Desktop System for the past few months. Ever since I purchased a Dell U3219Q monitor the cursed Desktop would not show the MB boot splash screen nor the Option to boot into the BIOS. Using a different monitor all worked just fine. I had been putting off investigations. I finally got around to connecting up a different monitor and booting into the UEFI BIOS. After reading the manual I toggled on a config for PCIE Compatibility and then stupidly updated the BIOS as well. Goes without saying that the thing now boots just fine and the Dell U3219Q shows the Splash screen and BIOS. Sadly I don't know which of these two things fixed or changed the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google course continues I am at the end of the first section and about to attempt the assignment. I have been enjoying doing this course and the practice/revision has been fun and good. Some of the questions have made me think and stretch my logic a bit which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOS 14 has been released today and I have applied it to the iPad &amp;amp; iPhone and am currently waiting (Not so patiently) for Watch OS 7 to install. Such a slow process has been going for over an hour and it is still not complete, no wonder it is usually done overnight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Google Courses</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/google-courses.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-01T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-01T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2020-09-01:/google-courses.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;6th post for my Blog.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been lots and lots of chatter and articles on the interwebs in the past few weeks about 
Google's Genius? Courses. These courses are offered on Coursera.org amd seem reasonable in price.
One such article is here. &lt;a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/googles-genius-49-mo-course-is-about-to-replace-college-degrees-340f459aaa9b"&gt;https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/googles-genius-49-mo-course-is-about-to-replace-college-degrees-340f459aaa9b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have enrolled in the "Google IT Automation with Python" course to see what it's like and if it is a good course
to recommend to others. The idea of giving people a quick and cost effective recognised course to help get skills up is
good. I don;t think it will replace a full Degree course but it will put a lot more people in a place where they can 
learn / absorb the on the job practise to get better at their jobs. There is a mention in the Introductory videos of how 
they hope to help Women to get into tech, a good idea just that I'm not sure how this will help. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Misc Stuff that needs doing</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/misc-stuff-that-needs-doing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-16T10:09:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-08-16T10:09:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2020-08-16:/misc-stuff-that-needs-doing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;5th post for my Blog.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a day of maintenance. Cleaned a keyboard, re-imaged and updated  some Ras-Pi's,
Swapped to a better 27" monitor for the test bench. Helped T get his Study Mojo back. Well I tried.

Have started on a journey of playing with Web Scraping, using the Real Python article &lt;a href="https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjIxNDUwMCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiM3QwZWpvaWRzZHYwajVpaWhqZTIiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlYWxweXRob24uY29tL3B5dGhvbi13ZWItc2NyYXBpbmctcHJhY3RpY2FsLWludHJvZHVjdGlvbi8_X19zPW92OXdzbTdjbXZmMXVzcXdncGl5In0"&gt;https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjIxNDUwMCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiM3QwZWpvaWRzZHYwajVpaWhqZTIiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlYWxweXRob24uY29tL3B5dGhvbi13ZWItc2NyYXBpbmctcHJhY3RpY2FsLWludHJvZHVjdGlvbi8_X19zPW92OXdzbTdjbXZmMXVzcXdncGl5In0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in speed between Ras-Pi 1 &amp;amp; Ras-Pi 4 is quite astounding, they are much much faster and still the same price. 
It gives me hoe that a RISC Mac Won't be a bad thing at all. 
Bug time::: MacOS BigSur, updates of the Beat causes Git and other things to stop working. 
This seems ot be due to the version reporting for the OS. 
The Solution, manually down load the latest Command LIne Tools beta from &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/"&gt;https://developer.apple.com/download/more/&lt;/a&gt;
Go through he process of re-install. This is a bit tedious as so far each and every Beta Update has made this re-install 
necessary...Sigh!!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Stick that up your PiHole</title><link href="https://bencastan.github.io/pihole_install.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-12T05:57:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-08-12T05:57:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Ben Castan</name></author><id>tag:bencastan.github.io,2020-08-12:/pihole_install.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;4th post for my Blog, This is interesting.&lt;/h1&gt;
